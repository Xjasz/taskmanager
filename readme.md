# Task Manager with Event Handling

This project is a task manager application that allows you to define and manage tasks through a GUI. It can automate interactions such as mouse clicks and keyboard actions based on user-defined events. The application is built using `Tkinter` for the GUI and includes features such as event creation, event chaining, task execution, and more.

## Features
- **Event Handling:** Create events such as mouse clicks or logic checks (text or color).
- **Task Management:** Create, save, and load tasks consisting of multiple events.
- **Event Execution:** Define whether an event should run at the start, repeat, or trigger other events based on conditions.
- **GUI Interface:** A clean and interactive Tkinter-based interface for managing events and tasks.
